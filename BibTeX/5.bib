abstract = {Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) revolutionize the ways different urban actors communicate and interact. Geographic information technologies are of key importance too for the deployment and implementation of ICTs in the Smart City, because of the central role they may play as decision-making support tools. Indeed, they give quick access to different layers of information that may be combined and integrated to facilitate analysis of a situation and make the best decisions. However, such a central role is rarely acknowledged. In this paper, we will tackle the transversal involvement of geomatics in a Smart City. We propose also to define the extent of the concept of Smart Cities and some of the distinctive features that it should display to support its sustainability.},
